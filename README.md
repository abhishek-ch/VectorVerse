# ðŸŽ­ VectorVerse
## â’¸ Unveiling Vector Databases & LLM Models

VectorVerse is an exploratory platform that serves as a hub for exploring the output of various Vector Databases. With VectorVerse, you have the opportunity to delve into the results produced by multiple Vector Databases. Additionally, you can utilize VectorVerse to compare the output generated by multiple Language Model (LLM) Models, including private models. This enables you to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of different data sources and models.

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

### Docker

Run `docker-compose up` and browse http://localhost:8501

### From Project

1. Git clone the project
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded
