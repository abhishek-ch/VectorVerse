# ðŸŽ­ VectorVerse
## â’¸ Unveiling Vector Databases & LLM Models

VectorVerse is an exploratory platform that serves as a hub for exploring the output of various Vector Databases. With VectorVerse, you have the opportunity to delve into the results produced by multiple Vector Databases. Additionally, you can utilize VectorVerse to compare the output generated by multiple Language Model (LLM) Models, including private models. This enables you to gain valuable insights and make informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of different data sources and models.

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

### Docker

Run `docker-compose up` and browse http://localhost:8501

### From Project

1. Git clone the project
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded

    ```bash
    cd vectorverse
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run `run_es.sh`, `run_pg.sh` & `run_redis.sh` or set up your own
4. Run the project and access the url http://localhost:8501

    ```
    python -m verse
    ```

## â›„ Optional (If using OpenAI)
Configure OpenAI Key
    * If Using OpenAI key, simply `export OPENAI_API_KEY=*****`
    * If want to use config file, rename `config_template.ini` -> `config.ini` file inside the `database_agent` dir & update either Azure or OpenAI config

    By completing these steps, you have properly configured the API Keys for your project.

## Prerequisites Installation

* Redis Stack Server
* ElasticSearch 

_Or use `docker-compose.yml` provided with the code_
 

### Run the Tool
0. Check out the project and go the project root dir `VectorVerse`

1. If Redis/ES not preinstalled
```docker
docker compose up
```

2. Launch the app
```python
python -m verse
```
